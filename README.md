## SISWA SIMULATOR

### Description of our game
The game is a text-based free roaming adventure where you, as a freshman of Universiti Sains Malaysia student will navigate through the campus. Being a freshman, you are trying to get back to your room and have little to no clue on the directions. Along the way, you will encounter various things and have the chance to get to know more on the campus' hidden gems and myths. The game is played by interacting with the text-based interface through commands entered by you.

Siswa Simulator is an exciting simulator game that puts you in the shoes of a Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) freshman student who finds yourself lost in campus and must navigate through the whole map to make it back to your room. Immerse yourself in the thrilling journey of survival, discovery and exploration within the confines of USM ground and unravel various hidden gems and myths.

As you delve deeper into the game, you'll unravel numerous mind blowing features of USM. Will you uncover the campus's dark secrets and successfully escape, or will you succumb to the challenges and remain trapped forever?


### Features of the game:
1. Room-based navigation: The game is structured around different rooms or locations that players can move between.
2. Object interaction: Players can interact with objects within the game world, potentially picking them up, using them, or combining them to progress.
3. Character interaction: The game involves interactions with characters, which may include conversations, quests, or challenges.
4. Objective-based gameplay: The game likely includes specific goals or objectives that players need to accomplish to advance further or complete the game.

### How to play the game:
To play the game, players typically enter commands or make choices through a text-based interface. They can explore different rooms, interact with objects and characters by typing commands, and solve puzzles or complete quests to progress in the game.

### How object-oriented concepts were used to develop the game:
Object-oriented concepts are commonly used in game development to organize and structure code. In your game, object-oriented programming (OOP) may have been employed to represent various entities within the game, such as rooms, objects, characters, and the player itself. Each of these entities can be represented as objects with their own properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

For example, a Room class could have attributes like name, description, and a list of objects present in that room. The Room object's methods could include functions for displaying the room description, adding or removing objects, and handling player interaction within the room.

Similarly, objects and characters in the game could be represented as classes, with their own attributes and behaviors. This approach allows for modular and organized code, making it easier to manage and expand the game's functionality.

### How linked lists play a role in the game:
Linked lists are a data structure commonly used in programming. While their specific role in your game is not entirely clear from the given information, linked lists could potentially be used to represent sequences or collections of objects or events in the game.

For instance, if your game has a sequence of actions or events that need to occur in a specific order, a linked list could be used to maintain and traverse that sequence. Each node in the linked list could represent an action or event, and the list's links would connect them in the correct order. This allows for easy iteration and management of the sequence.

Overall, the use of linked lists in your game would depend on the specific mechanics or features you have implemented, but they can provide a convenient way to organize and manipulate ordered collections of data.
